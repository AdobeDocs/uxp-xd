# Plugin Structure

One folder and two files: that's all it takes to create an XD plugin!

In this section, we'll tell you all about how plugins are structured. These tutorials will show you where to put your plugin files, how to name your plugin, and what files you need to create for an XD plugin.

- [Plugin Location and Name](/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/location/)
- [Folder Structure](/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/folder-structure/)
- [Plugin Menu Structure](/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/menu-structure/)
