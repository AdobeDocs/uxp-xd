# XD specific APIs

XD specific APIs enable developers to extend XD specific features. Using these APIs, developers can create plugins that create, read, update, and delete objects inside XD documents. Also, most other features available in XD, such as creating renditions, modifying assets panel, getting prototype data, conducting commands, and others are also available through these APIs.
