# Unified Extensibility Platform (UXP)

Unified Extensibility Platform (UXP) is a new extensibility architecture that provides commonly used APIs across different Creative Cloud applications. These common APIs include File I/O, Network I/O, and a User Interface layer. In this API reference docs, we organized UXP APIs into three categories:

- [Network](/reference/uxp/network-index/)
- [Storage](/reference/uxp/storage-index/)
- [Shell](/reference/uxp/module/shell/)
- [OS](/reference/uxp/module/os/)
- [UI](/reference/uxp/ui-index/)
