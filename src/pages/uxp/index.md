Important Changes for XD Plugin Distribution in the Marketplace

We are no longer accepting <i>new</i> plugins for Adobe XD in [our Marketplace](http://exchange.adobe.com/creativecloud). 

Existing published plugins can continue to be managed and updated via the Developer Distribution portal. The UXP Developer Tool (UDT) will continue to support plugin development. 

Visit the [FAQs](https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/faq/) page for more details and refer to [this document](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/support/xd.html) for the overall plans for Adobe XD.
