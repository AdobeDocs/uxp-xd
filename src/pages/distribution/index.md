Important Changes for XD Plugin Distribution in the Marketplace

On November 15th, 2024, we will stop accepting <i>new</i> plugins for Adobe XD in [our Marketplace](http://exchange.adobe.com/creativecloud). 

Existing published plugins can continue to be managed and updated via the Developer Distribution portal. The UXP Developer Tool (UDT) will continue to support plugin development. 

Visit the [FAQs](https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/faq/) page for more details and refer to [this document](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/support/xd.html) for the overall plans for Adobe XD.

# Sharing Your Plugin

Unless you've written a plugin solely for yourself, you're probably going to want to share it with others. This section explains how to take your plugin into the wider world, and let other users know about it.
